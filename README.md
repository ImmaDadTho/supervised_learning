# supervised_learning

### In this activity I will be building a model to predict wether a loan will be approved or not.
 I will use two machine learning models and see which one performs better. The two models are 
 `Logistic Regression` and `Random Forest Classifier`.
 
 Starting this activity I provided a prediction on which model would perform better and upon 
 completion of both models and fitting them then scoring them my prediction do not come to 
 fruition. You will see that contrary to my prediction the Logistec Regression Model performed
 slightly better than my predicted Random Forest Classifier.
